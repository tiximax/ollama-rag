Deep Learning and Neural Networks

Deep Learning is a specialized branch of machine learning based on artificial neural networks with multiple layers. These deep neural networks can learn hierarchical representations of data.

Neural Network Architecture:
- Input Layer: Receives raw data
- Hidden Layers: Extract features and patterns
- Output Layer: Produces final predictions

Key Components:
1. Neurons: Basic computational units
2. Weights: Connection strengths between neurons
3. Activation Functions: Introduce non-linearity (ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh)
4. Backpropagation: Algorithm for training networks

Popular Architectures:
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): Excellent for image processing
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): Handle sequential data
- Transformers: State-of-the-art for NLP tasks
- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): Generate new data

Training Techniques:
- Batch Normalization: Stabilizes training
- Dropout: Prevents overfitting
- Transfer Learning: Leverages pre-trained models
- Data Augmentation: Increases training data diversity

Applications:
Deep learning excels in computer vision, speech recognition, language translation, and game playing (like AlphaGo).
