Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

RAG is an advanced AI technique that enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge through document retrieval. This approach combines the power of semantic search with generative AI.

How RAG Works:
1. Document Ingestion: Text documents are split into chunks
2. Embedding Generation: Each chunk is converted to vector embeddings
3. Vector Storage: Embeddings are stored in a vector database
4. Query Processing: User queries are embedded using the same model
5. Similarity Search: Most relevant document chunks are retrieved
6. Context Augmentation: Retrieved chunks are added to LLM prompt
7. Generation: LLM generates response with retrieved context

Vector Databases:
Vector databases are specialized for storing and searching high-dimensional vectors. Popular options include:
- ChromaDB: Lightweight, easy to use
- Pinecone: Managed, scalable
- Weaviate: Open-source, feature-rich
- FAISS: Fast similarity search by Facebook

Semantic Search:
Unlike keyword search, semantic search understands meaning and context. It uses cosine similarity to find documents similar to the query vector.

Benefits of RAG:
- Reduces hallucinations by grounding responses in factual data
- Enables LLMs to access up-to-date information
- Provides source attribution for generated answers
- More cost-effective than fine-tuning for knowledge updates

Key Components:
- Embedding Models: Transform text to vectors (e.g., sentence-transformers)
- Vector Index: Enables fast approximate nearest neighbor search
- Reranking: Improves relevance of retrieved documents
- Caching: Speeds up repeated queries
