Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. ML algorithms build mathematical models based on sample data, known as training data, to make predictions or decisions.

Key Concepts:
1. Supervised Learning: Learning from labeled data
2. Unsupervised Learning: Finding patterns in unlabeled data
3. Reinforcement Learning: Learning through trial and error

Common Algorithms:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Neural Networks
- Support Vector Machines
- Random Forests

Applications:
Machine learning powers many modern applications including recommendation systems, image recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous vehicles.

Training Process:
The training process involves feeding data to the algorithm, adjusting model parameters, and evaluating performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
