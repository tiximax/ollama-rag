## 📊 Current Baseline Metrics (at start)

### Circuit Breaker
```
State: CLOSED
Total Calls: 0
Success Rate: 100%
Status: ✅ HEALTHY
```

### Connection Pool
```
Total Requests: 0
Pool Size: 15 / 30
Status: ✅ ACTIVE
```

### Semantic Cache
```
Enabled: YES
Hit Rate: 0%
Cache Size: 0 / 2000
Status: 📊 WARMING UP
```

---

## 🎯 What to Watch For

### Success Indicators
- ✅ Circuit Breaker stays CLOSED (>95% of time)
- ✅ No consecutive failures building up
- ✅ Connection pool showing requests increase
- ✅ Cache hit rate trending upward over time
- ✅ Cache size growing as queries processed

### Warning Signs
- ⚠️ Circuit Breaker state changes to OPEN
- ⚠️ Consecutive failures >3
- ⚠️ Success rate drops below 95%
- ⚠️ Server stops responding

### Critical Issues
- 🚨 Circuit Breaker stuck OPEN >5 minutes
- 🚨 Success rate <80%
- 🚨 Metrics endpoints return errors
- 🚨 Server crashes

## 🧪 How to Generate Traffic for Testing

### Option 1: Simple Health Check Loop
```powershell
# Run in a separate window
while ($true) {
    try {
        $response = Invoke-RestMethod http://localhost:8001/health
        Write-Host "✅ Health check OK" -ForegroundColor Green
    } catch {
        Write-Host "❌ Health check failed" -ForegroundColor Red
    }
    Start-Sleep -Seconds 5
}
```

### Option 2: Use Existing Endpoints
```powershell
# Test various endpoints
$endpoints = @(
    "http://localhost:8001/health",
    "http://localhost:8001/api/circuit-breaker/metrics",
    "http://localhost:8001/api/connection-pool/metrics",
    "http://localhost:8001/api/semantic-cache/metrics"
)

foreach ($endpoint in $endpoints) {
    Invoke-RestMethod $endpoint
    Start-Sleep -Milliseconds 500
}
```

### Option 3: Run Load Tests
If you have Ollama service available:
```powershell
.\scripts\load_test.ps1
```
(Note: Load test script would need to be created)

## 📈 Expected Progression

### First 5 Minutes (Warming Up)
- Circuit Breaker: CLOSED, minimal calls
- Connection Pool: 0-10 requests
- Cache Hit Rate: 0%
- Cache Size: 0-5 entries

### After 10 Minutes (With Traffic)
- Circuit Breaker: CLOSED, 50-100 calls
- Connection Pool: 20-50 requests
- Cache Hit Rate: 5-10% (warming up)
- Cache Size: 10-30 entries

### After 30 Minutes (Steady State)
- Circuit Breaker: CLOSED, 200+ calls
- Connection Pool: 100+ requests
- Cache Hit Rate: 20-30% (target achieved)
- Cache Size: 50-100 entries

### After 1 Hour (Production-Like)
- Circuit Breaker: CLOSED, 500+ calls
- Connection Pool: 300+ requests
- Cache Hit Rate: 30-40% (excellent)
- Cache Size: 100-200 entries

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Monitoring Window Closes
Relaunch with:
```powershell
.\scripts\monitor_staging_fixed.ps1
```

### Metrics Show Errors
Check server is still running:
```powershell
Get-Process python -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

If no processes found, restart server:
```powershell
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001 --reload
```

### Want to Stop Monitoring
- Go to monitoring window
- Press `Ctrl+C`
- Window will remain open for review

### Want to Save Metrics
Take screenshots or copy-paste metrics at intervals for documentation.

## 📝 What to Do While Monitoring

### Option A: Let it Run & Watch
- Watch for 15-30 minutes
- Observe metrics changes
- Take notes on behavior
- Screenshot interesting states

### Option B: Generate Some Traffic
- Run health checks in loop
- Call various endpoints
- Test different scenarios
- Observe cache building up

### Option C: Move to Next Task
- Monitoring runs in background
- You can work on other things
- Check back periodically
- Continue with Sprint 1 tasks:
  - Commit & push changes
  - Create Pull Request
  - Document findings
  - Plan Sprint 2
