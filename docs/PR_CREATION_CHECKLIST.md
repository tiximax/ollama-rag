## 🚀 After PR Approval

### Merge Options

#### Option 1: Merge Commit (Recommended)
```bash
# Preserves full history
Merge pull request #X from tiximax/optimization/sprint-1
```

**Pros**: Complete history, easy rollback
**Cons**: More commits in main

#### Option 2: Squash and Merge
```bash
# Combines all commits into one
feat: Sprint 1 Performance Optimizations
```

**Pros**: Clean main branch history
**Cons**: Loses detailed commit history

#### Option 3: Rebase and Merge
```bash
# Linear history
All individual commits moved to main
```

**Pros**: Linear history
**Cons**: More complex, harder rollback

**Recommendation**: Use **Merge Commit** để giữ full history cho Sprint 1.

### Post-Merge Actions

1. **Tag the merge commit**:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git tag -a v1.0.0-sprint1 -m "Sprint 1: Performance Optimizations Complete"
   git push origin v1.0.0-sprint1
   ```

2. **Delete feature branch** (optional):
   ```bash
   git branch -d optimization/sprint-1
   git push origin --delete optimization/sprint-1
   ```

3. **Deploy to staging**:
   ```bash
   # Follow STAGING_DEPLOYMENT_READY.md
   git checkout main
   uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001
   ```

4. **Monitor metrics** for 24-48 hours:
   - Circuit breaker state
   - Cache hit rate
   - Connection pool usage
   - Error rates

5. **Create deployment report**:
   - Document actual vs expected metrics
   - Note any issues or surprises
   - Update configuration if needed
